        <h2><u>Silent Hill 3</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Silent Hill 3 is a 2003 survival horror game developed by Team Silent,<br/> 
            a group in Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, and published by Konami. <br/>
            The game was released from May to August, originally for the PlayStation 2. <br/>
            The third installment in the Silent Hill series and a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game, <br/>
            it follows Heather, a teenager who becomes entangled in the machinations of the town's cult,<br/>
            which seeks to revive a malevolent deity. A port for Microsoft Windows was released later in November,<br/>
             and a remastered high-definition version was released as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection,<br/>
              for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.

            Originally planned to be a rail shooter, as a result of the initially slow sales of Silent Hill 2 in Japan,<br/>
             Silent Hill 3 was developed almost simultaneously alongside another installment in the series, Silent Hill 4: The Room (2004).<br/>
              Among the influences on Silent Hill 3 are the film Jacob's Ladder and the works of horror novelist Stephen King.<br/>
               Silent Hill 3 sold over 300,000 copies by November 2003 and was well-received by critics, garnering praise for<br/>
                its presentation, including the environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes<br/>
                 that are continued from past installments; although there was minor criticism of the game's short length, camera,<br/>
                  and gameplay mechanics. Its plot was loosely adapted into the 2012 film Silent Hill: Revelation.</p>
